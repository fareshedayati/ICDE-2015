% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


%\usepackage{program}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}

%\usepackage[]{algorithm2e}


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}

Many machine learning tasks involve sparsely representable input space. State-
of-the-art tree-based ensemble algorithms and implementation have focused on
tasks with dense input space, while at most emulating random memory access on
sparse input data. We propose a fast and an efficient splitting algorithm to
leverage input sparsity within decision tree methods. We exploit the a-priori
knowledge that each column have very few non-zero elements and show how
learning time is significantly decreased.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

High dimensional supervised learning problems, e.g. in text processing or image
exploitation, are more frequent than ever. While those datasets have very high
dimensional input space, they are often sparsely representable. For instance,
the number of unique words associated to a text document is actually small
compared to the total number of words of a given language. In order to work
efficiently sparsely representable data, efficient matrix formats have been
developed such as compressed sparse column matrix format with fast matrix
operations, such as dot product, with a low memory footprint.

Tree-based ensemble models, such as adaboost \cite{freund1995desicion}, random
forest \cite{breiman2001random} or gradient tree boosting
\cite{friedman2001greedy}, are some of the most robust and widely-used
supervised machine learning. Randomized decision trees
\cite{breiman1984classification} are built on all or a bootstrap copy of the
samples by recursively maximizing the reduction of an impurity measure, e.g.
the output variance. At each node, the best split is selected among $k$
randomly selected features. This recursive procedure is repeated until a
stopping condition is met, e.g. a maximal depth is reached or there are too few
samples to split. Leaves are labeled by the mean in regression or by the class
frequencies in classification with reaching training samples. Predictions will
be made by aggregating the the prediction of each tree of the ensemble.

Many models, such as linear or nearest neighbors model, could directly benefit
from the input sparsity by formulating the entire algorithm through a set of
dot products. Since this is not possible for tree based methods, most machine
learning package don't support sparse input for tree-based methods, are
restricted to decision stump (decision tree with only one internal node) or
have a sub-optimal implementation through the simulation of a random access
memory as in the dense case. The only solution is often to densified the input
space which leads first to severe memory constraints and then to slow
training time.

In this paper, we present an efficient splitting procedure tailored for
numerical sparse input data in compressed sparse column format. For a given
subset of samples, we are able to efficiently extract non zero values for a
given feature of this subset of samples. Knowing which elements are non zeros
allows large speed up. It reduces the set of possible split to evaluate at
each node. We also want to highlight that the contribution of this paper have
been proposed for inclusion to the  \emph{scikit-learn}
\cite{buitinck2013api,pedregosa2011scikit} open source package. This will
benefit to the machine learning community.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:background}
introduces decision tree splitting algorithm; Section \ref{sec:sparse-input-dt}
describe the proposed splitting algorithm for sparse input data; Section
\ref{sec:experiments} provides our empirical implementation study and Section
\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes and describes further perspectives.

\section{Background: decision tree} \label{sec:background}

In this section we briefly go over training decision trees and in the next
section we will show how to tweak this algorithm for support of sparse inputs.
Let $X$ be a matrix of dimension $n \times d$ where $d$ is the dimension of the
feature space and $n$ is the number of training instances, i.e. each row
corresponds to an instance and each column corresponds to a feature. Moreover
we let $Y$ be a vector of size $n$ that contains the target variables, e.g. the
target variable of instance $i$ is at $Y[i]$. Note that the in the function
\emph{FIT} below, $min\_samples\_split$, $min\_samples\_leaf$ and $max\_depth$
are regularization parameters for prevention of overfitting.
$min\_samples\_split$ is the minimum number of training instances required in a
node before a split is carried on the node, $min\_samples\_leaf$ is the minimum
number of instances required in the node and $max\_depth$ is the maximum depth
of the tree. As soon as there are too few instances in the current node or the
best split of the current node leave at least one of the children with too few
instances or the tree becomes too deep no further splitting is carried out and
the current node becomes a leaf node. The tree can be grown alternatively in a
best-first search manner in which case $max\_leaf\_nodes$ is needed as well.
$max\_features$, $splitter$ and $criterion$ are other parameters of the model.
Since our tweak is independent of these parameters we only cover training
decision trees for classification in a depth-first search manner with
information gain. Our change works well with all tree variations. For more
details refer to the latest merge in \emph{scikit-learn} in the tree and
random-forests sections \cite{scikit-learn}.

To avoid rearranging the whole matrix at the time of sorting, we use an
auxiliary data structure \emph{samples} to rearrange the indices of the
training dataset only, keeping $X$ and $Y$ unchanged. Initially
$samples[i] = i$ for $i \in \{0,1,\cdots, n-1\}$, where $n$ is the number of
training instances. Each node is specified by two numbers $start$ and $end$.
These two numbers along with $samples$ specifies the indices of $X, Y$ that
are in the current node: $samples[start:end]$. Note that we use this name to
be consistent with \emph{scikit-learn} \cite{scikit-learn}.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{FIT}{$start =0, end = n, Node, depth$}
\If {$|end - start| < min\_samples\_split$ or $depth > max\_depth$ }

\section{Decision on sparse input data} \label{sec:sparse-input-dt}


For memory efficiency and taking advantage of sparsity we use a data structure
called \emph{scipy.sparse.csc\_matrix}. This data structure has a common use in
\emph{scikit-learn}. It consists of four parts: \emph{indices}, \emph{indptr},
\emph{data} and $shape$ which contains the dimensions of the matrix. The
indices for column $f$ are stored in:

\begin{equation}
indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]],
\end{equation}
with the corresponding values at
\begin{equation}
data[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]].
\end{equation}

For example if the $indptr$, $indices$, and $data$ of a $(3 \times 3)$ $csc\_matrix$ be the following:
\begin{align*}
indptr &= [0,2,3,6]\\
indices &= [0,2,2,0,1,2]\\
data &= [1,2,3,4,5,6]
\end{align*}

Then the (dense) matrix itself should be:
$[1, 0, 4$\\
$\,\, 0, 0, 5$\\
$\,\,2, 3, 6]$\\


The only part of the $BestFit$ algorithm of the previous section that changes
is the way we sort the training matrix along a feature. For a given feature $f$
we first find all instances in $samples[start:end]$ where feature $f$ is non-
zero. We, then sort the positive and negative parts separately and rearrange
$samples[start:end]$ accordingly.

The challenge in finding instances in $samples[start:end]$ with non-zero values
of $f$ is that of finding the intersection of $indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$
and $samples[start:end]$. Depending on the size of these two sets we can either
perform a binary search or an exhaustive search. For the latter end we need an
additional auxiliary data structure that we call $index\_to\_samples$ which is
a reverse map of $samples$ to its indices, i.e. $index\_to\_samples[j] = i$
when $samples[i] = j$.

If the size of the current node, i.e. $end - start$, is small then we can sort
$samples[start:end]$ and for each instance in $samples[start:end]$ do a binary
search in $indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$, this way we can find the
intersection of two sets which is the set of instance of the current node with
non-zero values of feature $f$. On the other hand if the size of the current
node is large, sorting the set might be costly and we do an exhaustive search
instead. Note that we always keep $index\_to\_samples$ up-to-date. For each
instance $index$ in $indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$ if
$index\_to\_samples[index]$ is not between $start$ and $end$ then that instance
is not in the current node. So we only keep instances in
$indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$ when their corresponding $index\_to\_samples$
is between $start$ and $end$.

We define the following two variables for the current feature $f$
\begin{equation}
n\_indices = indptr[f+1] - indptr[f]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
n\_samples = end - start.
\end{equation}

Sorting of $samples[start:end]$ takes $O(n\_samples \times \log(n\_samples))$
and binary search of instances of $samples[start:end]$ in
$indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$ takes $O(n\_samples \times \log(n\_indices))$.
Sorting of $samples[start:end]$ happens only once in a $BestSplit$ call for all
candidate features, and the binary search happens for each candidate feature.
On the other hand, the exhaustive search takes $O(n\_indices)$ time. We let $C$
be: $$ n\_samples  \times \log(n\_samples) + n\_samples \times \log(n\_indices)
$$ After testing with different coefficients we came up with the following rule
for the candidate feature $f$:

\begin{algorithmic}
\If{$C  < 0.1 \times n\_indices \,\, $}
\State \emph{ First sort $samples[start:end]$ if it is not already sorted, then for each instance in $samples[start:end]$ carry on a binary search in $indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$}
\Else
\State \emph{For each index in $indices[indptr[f]:indptr[f+1]]$ check if its in $samples[start:end]$ by verifying that its $index\_to\_samples$ is between $start$ and $end$.}
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiments}

The first test was carried on the \emph{20 Newsgroups} dataset. The dataset
consists of $20000$ news groups documents distributed across $20$ newsgroups
almost evenly \cite{joachims1996probabilistic}. Training was carried on with
different parameters of $max\_depth$, once with the $csc\_matrix$ sparse matrix
and once with dense matrix. As it can be seen in Figure~\ref{20 news groups},
the training time with dense inputs is much higher than the in their sparse
counterparts. We verified that all $4$ fitted trees are identical.

The second set of tests were carried on synthetic data. Random matrices were
generated with different shapes and densities where a density is the percentage
of non-zero values of a feature. For example a density of $0.1$ means that
every feature is only $10\%$ of the time non-zero. Each matrix was represented
both in a sparse and dense format. Decision trees were fitted once with the
sparse and once in the dense format. Table~\ref{density} contains the training
time of these matrices (the last two columns). As it can be seen in this table
the training time of sparse matrices is much lower that their dense
counterparts when the density of matrix is quite low, i.e. less $0.1$. For no-
quite sparse matrices, e.g. $density = 0.5$, the training time with dense
inputs is lower than their sparse counterparts. As this table suggests
$csc\_matrix$ should only be used in sparse data, e.g. textual data.
